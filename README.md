## Metis Data Science Bootcamp Project2
### Cost of a Home in San Francisco

### Description
 High paid jobs, great food, fun activities, fabulous weather, just to name a few of the reasons San Francisco has attracted talents all over the United States. Some may come and go. However, many love the  city enough to consider buying a house and staying long-term. For those who are thinking of purchasing a house in the city, they may want to know:
1. is this a good time to buy? 
2. what property type can we offer? 
3. where in the city is more affordable? 
4. what is the price we should offer for our target property? 

Property price in San Francisco has increased continously from 2012 to 2019 for 126%. Today, the majority of the properties in San Francisco costs over a million dollars. In this project, with the data scraped from a real estate listing website, I am looking into the factors that affect the property price in San Francisco in the past year. I am hoping to build a linear regression model that could accurately predict the property price. 

### Features and Target Variables

- year built
- lot size
- property type
- neighborhood

Target variable: price sold

### Data Used
Web scraped data from Redfin

### Possible impacts of my project
- Help home buyers in San Francisco to determine if they could afford to buy a hosue in the city and to make informed decision on house price offer. 
- This can also help house owners who are considering selling their property to determine if it's a good time to sell now and set a reasonable listing price for their property
