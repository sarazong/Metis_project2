### Project -- Predicting House Price in San Francisco

### Description
 High paid jobs, great food, fun activities, fabulous weather, just to name a few of the reasons San Francisco has attracted talents all over the United States. Some may come and go. However, many love the  city enough to consider buying a house and staying long-term. For those who are thinking of purchasing a house in the city, they may want to know (1) is this a good time to buy? (2) what property type can we offer? (3) where in the city is more affordable? (4) what is the price we should offer for our target property? The property price in San Francisco has doubled in the past decade. Today, the majority of the properties in San Francisco costs over a million dollars. In this project, arming with the data scraped from real estate website, I am looking into the factors that affect the property price in San Francisco this past year. I am hoping to build a linear regression model that could accurately predict the property price.
