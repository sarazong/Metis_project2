## Metis_project2: Cost of a Home in San Francisco

### Description
 High paid jobs, great food, fun activities, fabulous weather, just to name a few of the reasons San Francisco has attracted talent all over the United States. Some may come and go. However, many love the  city enough to consider buying a home and staying long-term. For those who are thinking of purchasing a home in the city, they may want to know:
1. is this a good time to buy? 
2. what property type can we offer? 
3. where in the city is more affordable? 
4. what is the price we should offer for our target property? 

Property price in San Francisco has increased continously from 2012 to 2019 for 126%. Today, the majority of the properties in San Francisco costs over a million dollars. In this project, with the data scraped from a real estate listing website, I am looking into the factors that affect the property price in San Francisco in the past year. I am hoping to build a linear regression model that could accurately predict the property price.

- Help home buyers in San Francisco determine if they could afford to buy a home in the city and to make informed decision on house price offers. 
- This can also help property owners who consider selling their properties to determine if it's a good time to sell now and set a reasonable listing price for their properties.
