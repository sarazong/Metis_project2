## Metis Data Science Bootcamp Project2
### Project -- Predicting House Price in San Francisco

### Description
 Great food, high paying jobs, fun activities, fabulous weather, just to name a few, the reasons San Francisco has attracted talents all over the United States. However, if you consider growing your root in San Francisco by buying a house and start a family, two of the inevitable questions you would face is: can I afford to buy a house in the city? If yes, what is the price I should offer for my target house? The house price in San Francisco has doubled in the past decade. Today, the majority of the houses in San Francisco costs over a million dollars. In this project, arming with the data to be scraped from Redfin, I am hoping to look into the factors that affect the house price in San Francisco in the past year.
